Hello this is feature 1
The following lines describe how we're gonna build this epic shit
Step #1:
    Put your shit together
Step #2:
    Learn programming not languages
Step #3:
    Start building epic shits right off the bat
Step #4:
    Sometimes, during your development of a project(side project, or business) you'll get
    a feeling of frustration and disappointment but just ignore it
    I don't know your conditions or situation, but the point is you don't have to quit
    Keep going..
Step #5:
    This is the last step to follow, in order to succeed in this field
    The majjority of companies, when they start to hiring people, they look for people with
    experience, and that's important and this is the truth. Actually, they are right in some extent because
    an experienced programmer will start do the job directly without overhead of asking lot of questions
    But, you know you don't have a degree (you) and you don't have experience, so you have to build
    something huge (very very very huge) to show these assholes who are ya and what you can do ;)
                                        TRUST ME, SOME DAY YOU'LL BE PROUD BECAUSE YOU WROTE THOSE WORDS.
